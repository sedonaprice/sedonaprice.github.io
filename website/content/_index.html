<h2>About</h2>


<p>
    I am an observational astronomer interested in
    galaxy formation and evolution, using imaging and spectroscopy
    from both ground- and space-based telescopes
    and developing analysis tools
    to study both population-level properties
    as well as the detailed nature of individual galaxies. 
    I'm currently working as an Astronomical Data Scientist 
    in the Data Management Division at STScI.

<p>
    I've focused on studying distant galaxies as they existed billions
    of years ago, near the peak epoch of cosmic star formation
    ("cosmic noon" at z~1-3) and at earlier times.
    Much of my work has involved characterizing these galaxies' structures,
    composition, and inner dynamics, which allow us to understand
    mass assembly and transformations as galaxies grow, evolve,
    and eventually quench.
